#####Lab_03 Part 2 introduction

My intitial goal for part 2 of lab 3 was to create a thematic map map showing viewsheds and scenic overlooks above 5000' elevation in North Carolina.  I was unable to locate shapefiles to display the data for this initial project.  Therefore, I chose to create a thematic map displaying the locations of DC fast charging stations for electric vehicles in NC.  The title of this map is **NC DC Fast Charging Stations**.

I included _leaflet.css_ and _leaflet.js_ early in my code using HTML.  I obtained three shapefiles and converted them into geoJson format.  The source for for the locations of the DC EV chargers is https://afdc.energy.gov/corridors.  The NC County boundaries source comes from NC OneMap and is listed as https://gis11.services.ncdot.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NCDOT_CountyBdy_Poly/MapServer/0.
